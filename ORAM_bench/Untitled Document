The experimental result depends on the preset argurment (the cache degree 'c') and the data locality. For example, if allocated a data space with 10,000 data block, and during the access, only 5,000 of them is used, we can say the locality is 0.5 (the smaller, the denser). In the experiment, we set the locality to 0.125/0.75 = 0.166 and generate the random test cases. We tested the Filebench today, and we extract three test cases from it: (webserver, oltp, varmail), and found their localiy is (0.13, 0.04, 0.015). We run those three test cases using the same setting as Table 3, the second row of Table 3 is renewed to (,6658,)

Above all, the test cases is not the
